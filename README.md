# Study on how meditation affects anxiety

### Files

**StudentWellbeingSurveyData_cleaned.xlsx:** Excel sheet that has multiple sheets with seperate survey data from students.  This dataset was intentionally scrubbed to protect the confidentiality of the patients.

**data_cleaning.ipynb:** Main python file that runs data analysis

### How to Use
Run **data_cleaning.ipynb** and see visualizations and statistic results.

### Additional Improvements
The inital excel sheet was cleaned manually in excel before reading into the jupyter notebook file.  My next improvement would be to automate this process.
